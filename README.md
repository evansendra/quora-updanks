Here's how it works: navigate to a question page on quora, the extension will add a button to the 3 dot dropdown menu to "sort by upvotes", which well then sort answers by upvotes.

## Known Issues

See issues for known issues, the major one being that pressing the button loses the ability to get new answers without page reload, and it only sorts answers currently loaded to the page (to prevent loading all answers to popular questions).  This could be improved as well.
